Yugen is a fairly simple 2d puzzle game & platformer. The core mechanic of the game is Yugen’s ability to ‘glow’. Left click allows the player to emit a blue glow that can destroy walls, middle mouse emits a yellow glow that can activate torches and runes in the word, and right click emits a short white glow to harm enemies. The player can also press ‘B’ to ‘Soul Swap’ , emitting their soul so they can swap into available bodies - those that look like the player character. The player moves left and right with ‘A’ & ‘D’ respectively, and can use ‘W’ or ‘SPACE’ to jump. These are most often on the other side of some wall or otherwise impassable gap, as the soul can move past these. The core gameplay loop involves progressing through a level trying to activate torches, runes and crystals in order to open doors or activate platforms. Most levels have a set of runes or crystals that must be activated to progres, but in some simply making it to the end is enough.  

The game is structured in three sets of 3 levels - three green, three purple and three blue. Every third level is a ‘boss level’.
